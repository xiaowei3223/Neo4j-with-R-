This repo mainly discuss neo4j perform with R, you can get data.frame/list results from neo4j for your further research. Those R packages including [RNeo4j](https://github.com/nicolewhite/RNeo4j),
[neo4jshell](https://github.com/keithmcnulty/neo4jshell)
and [neo4r](https://github.com/neo4j-rstats/neo4r).

I strongly recommend neo4r to you when you want get data.frame with R. Because neo4r can prove more about node details.
